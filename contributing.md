# Contributing to Near Future Spacecraft

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! This can really help velocity and ensures that problems get fixed faster.

Here are a few notes to follow that will make things easier for everyone:

* **Please submit all pull requests against the `dev` branch**
* If creating a new **compatibility patch**, please add attribution to the file in the first line as a comment, e.g. `// USI-LS Patch by ChrisAdderley`
* If submitting a new **translation**, please add attribution to the file in the first line as a comment, e.g. `// English Translation by ChrisAdderley`. It is also helpful to me if you can update the readme with the attribution as well.
